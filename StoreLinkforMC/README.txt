Connect your WooCommerce store with a Minecraft server. Deliver in-game items when an order is completed, using a secure and customizable REST API.

== Description ==

**StoreLink for Minecraft** allows you to automatically deliver Minecraft items or execute commands after a WooCommerce purchase is completed.

Perfect for store owners who sell in-game items or ranks. This plugin connects your website to your Minecraft server securely, reliably, and easily.

**Main Features:**

- üîó Sync WooCommerce products with Minecraft items or commands.
- üöÄ Auto-delivery on order completion.
- üîí API token authentication for secure access.
- üì¶ Delivery queue management with a pending/delivered system.
- üõ† Admin tools for rebuilding database, viewing table structure, and debugging.
- üîß Supports LiteSpeed / WP Rocket / caching plugins safely.
- üåç Full REST API support.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install directly from the plugin repository.
2. Activate the plugin via the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô screen in WordPress.
3. Visit **StoreLink for MC > Settings** to generate your API token.
4. Configure your Minecraft plugin to use that token and domain.
5. Optional: Configure delivery products and commands in the `products` section of your Minecraft plugin config.
6. Done! Orders from WooCommerce will now sync with Minecraft.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin connect directly to Minecraft? =
No. It exposes a secure REST API endpoint that your Minecraft server connects to for fetching pending deliveries.

= Is there a Pro version? =
Yes. The free version supports up to 3 product mappings. The Pro version offers unlimited mappings and additional integrations.

= Does it work with LiteSpeed Cache or WP Rocket? =
Yes. You should exclude the API routes `/wp-json/storelinkformc/v1/*` from caching. This ensures fresh data is always returned.

= Can I manage deliveries manually? =
Yes. Use the **Deliveries** admin page to edit, delete or reassign items per player.

== Debugging & Tools ==

The **Settings** page provides:

- üß™ View current DB table structure.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Rebuild the `pending_deliveries` table.
- üîë Regenerate API token.
- üßπ Flush WordPress object cache.
- üõ† Access recommendation for WP phpMyAdmin or Adminer for deeper inspection.


== Changelog ==

= Version 1.0.22 =

- Removed inline `<script>` from `storelinkformc_render_account_sync_page()` to comply with WordPress.org guidelines.
+ Added `filemtime()` as version argument in all `wp_enqueue_script()` calls to improve cache-busting during development.
+ Added user confirmation dialogs to `deliveries.js` for all destructive actions: deleting, resetting, and bulk clearing.
+ Created `assets/js/unlink-account.js` to manage Minecraft account unlinking from the frontend.
+ Created base admin JS scripts (`admin.js`, `products.js`, `checkout-fields.js`, `sync-roles.js`) with DOM readiness checks and console logs for debugging.
+ Implemented proper JavaScript loading using `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_localize_script()` only on pages with `[storelinkformc_account_sync]`.
+ Secured AJAX unlink requests with `wp_ajax_storelinkformc_unlink_account` and nonce verification.
+ Prevented unnecessary script loading for non-logged-in users and pages without the shortcode.
+ Fixed fatal syntax error due to missing bracket in `storelinkformc_enqueue_scripts()`.
+ Standardized enqueueing for all admin pages: settings, products, deliveries, checkout fields, and role sync ‚Äî now each uses a versioned external JS file.
+ Ensured all JavaScript files are wrapped in `DOMContentLoaded` and scoped defensively to avoid errors on unrelated admin pages.
+ Verified correct WooCommerce dependency checks on settings and product pages.
+ Improved feedback and error handling in the unlink workflow: success, failure, and network error messages.
